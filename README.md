# Digital-Logic-Design

Project 1: Switch-Level Design and Simulation of Digital Circuits

This project involves designing and simulating the switch-level structure of digital circuits using nMOS and pMOS transistors. The focus is on creating a 2-input NAND gate, NOT gate, 3-input Majority gate, and XOR gate, and analyzing their delay characteristics.

Project 2: Full Adder and One's Counter Design

This project focuses on designing adders and counters, including a full adder and a one's counter, and extending them to handle larger bit-widths. The goal is to simulate and analyze the behavior and timing of these circuits using SystemVerilog and ModelSim.

Project 3: SR Latch, D Latch, and Sequence Adder Design

This project focuses on the design and simulation of SR latches, D latches, and sequence adders using Verilog. The goal is to explore the behavior and functionality of these circuits, modify them with additional features, and analyze their performance through simulation.

Project 4: Harmonic Sum Calculator with Orthogonal State Machine

This project involves designing a system to calculate the harmonic sum S_n for a given input n.The system uses an Orthogonal State Machine (FSM) to control the process of reading values from a ROM and summing them.

Project 5&6: Restoring Divider Accelerator Project

This project involves designing a Restoring Divider accelerator and interfacing it with an 8-bit bus for burst mode operation. The assignment is divided into two parts: Part 1: Divider Module Design and Part 2: 8-Bit Bus
